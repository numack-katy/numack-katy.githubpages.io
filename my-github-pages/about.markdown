title: About Katy
---

I'm a late-diagnosed autistic/ADHD maximalist, Appalachian zine queen, coach-in-training, and digital archive enthusiast.  
I build rituals, archives, and digital weirdness for people who never felt "centered."  
If you want to live a little weirder, softer, or louder, you're in the right place.

**More:**  
— Main character, not another node  
— Archivist for off-center lives  
— Licensed sticker hoarder  
— Pro at re-inventing the archive (and myself)
