title: Katy Welborn — Axis & Archive
subtitle: ND maximalist, zine queen, main character
---

Welcome to my digital axis.

**I'm Katy Welborn** — Appalachian maximalist, neurodivergent archive-builder, peer coach, and main character in a world built for background noise.

- ND-friendly peer coaching (currently in ICF training)
- Zine dispatches, digital rituals, sticker drops
- Permission to exist off-center, on purpose

*Main character energy, built in the mountains.  
Find your axis. Build your archive. Break the damn mold.*
